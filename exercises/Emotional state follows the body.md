# Emotional State Follows the Body

### Idea

influence your emotions with physical actions

### Activity

Talk group through these, collectively. Ask people to gauge their emotional reaction. Ask people to look at each other.
"Allow your emotion to follow your motion – no need to resist." 
"It's "fake" as in not spontaneous, but your hormonal response is real."


Physical activities to include:

- stand – to activate body
- actively use muscles – stretch and move arms, shift weight over legs, become aware of core
- breathe – expand the sides, focus on outbreath, visualise?
- alexander – consider above, behind
- arms apart, elbows bent, palms offered, wrists up – feel how it changes as you open your chin from your chest. Now look someone in the eyes.
- look surprised – widen the eyes, big mouth to Ooo! mouth, flare nostrils
- hand on chin, eyes top left – feel yourself step away from the now, into memory and analysis
- cross arms, lower head
- smile – full instructions, focus on eyes, top lip, 
- power pose? Refs Rob Lambert, Tory govt, superheroes

Explore this for a moment with your group. Move your body, listen to your emotions… think about doing something, and observe your body's reactions.
