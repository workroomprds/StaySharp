# How to have fun (in testing)

## Idea

To make a collection of ways that people make their testing work more fun. To use that aggregate to stimulate other ideas and memories.

## Activity

10-30 people stand in a circle (as open space)

Anyone may speak at any time, but everyone should listen. Perhaps use a scribe.

“*I think that we can find testing boring, but that interested testers are more engaged. How have you made testing fun? How might you?*"

## Testing relevance:

Direct

## Duration: 

20 mins

## Keywords:

## Traps:

- Becomes a list of ways to do better testing
- Becomes a list things that might make one feel good (not necessarily have fun)
- Becomes a list of complaints about how other people stop testing being fun.

These can't necessesarily be avoided, but it's good to acknowledge the pattern and move on.

## Variations

For groups of 6 or less, go round the group.

For groups of 25 or less, get everyone standing in a circle, encourge anyone to speake (and everyone to listen). Perhaps use a scribe.

If group is large, split and make flipchart of ideas to share at end. Shorten time to allow flipcharts to be examined by other group

For larger groups, split into circles of 20ish. Allow groups time to display and read each other's work.
